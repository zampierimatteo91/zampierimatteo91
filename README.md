Good to see you, stroller!

I am Matteo Zampieri, currently based in Den Haag 🇳🇱.

I was born as a Philosopher 💭, I tried to reedem myself as a Cognitive Neuroscientist 🧠, but I ended up messing up with computers  💻. 

Now I work as a Data Platform Engineer.

## interests
I consider myself quite inept in keeping still with only one interest at any time. I believe that one burden of today's society is that of rewarding individuals that specialize in one thing, thus promoting a sense of guilt in everyone that is drawn to multiple interests. This notwithstaning, I can recognize some staples that I always hop around:
- weightlifting / movement
- reading 
- boardgames and videogames
- getting lost in nature and appreciating what is good on this Earth
- cooking
- drawing
- philosophising over the unnecessary``
- dreaming of fighting alongside Aragorn
