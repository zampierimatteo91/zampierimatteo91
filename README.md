Good to see you, stroller!

I am Matteo Zampieri, currently based in Den Haag 🇳🇱.

💭 I was born as a Philosopher 

🧠 I tried to reedem myself as a Cognitive Neuroscientist

## 🎯 interests
I consider myself quite inept in keeping still with only one interest at any time. I believe that one burden of today's society is that of rewarding individuals that specialize in one thing, thus promoting a sense of guilt in everyone that is drawn to multiple interests. This notwithstaning, I can recognize some staples that I always hop around:
- 🏋️‍♂️ weightlifting / movement
- 📗 reading 
- 🎲 boardgames and videogames
- 🌲 getting lost in nature and appreciating what is good on this Earth
- 🍲 cooking
- 🖍️ drawing
- 🗣️ philosophising over the unnecessary
- 🧝 dreaming of fighting alongside Aragorn
